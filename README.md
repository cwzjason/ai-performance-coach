# AI Performance Review Coach

> Help new managers nail their first performance feedback conversation without a hitch — an interactive web-based simulation training tool.

[中文文档](./README_CN.md)

## Overview

Performance reviews are one of the most critical — and risky — actions for any manager. Too soft and it's ineffective; too harsh and employees may quit; off-target and it becomes personal. **AI Performance Review Coach** lets you practice one-on-one performance conversations with AI-simulated "real employees" in a safe environment, then provides a multi-dimensional evaluation report and improvement suggestions afterward.

### Core Value

- **Zero-risk practice** — Rehearse in a virtual environment without fear of saying the wrong thing or damaging relationships
- **Realistic employee simulation** — AI dynamically generates emotional responses based on employee profiles (High-Potential / Steady / Needs Improvement)
- **Instant feedback** — Automatically generates a performance review quality score report with flagged pitfalls
- **Scenario-based training** — 5 common problem scenarios + custom backgrounds, covering 3×5=15 combinations

### 📊 Smart Evaluation Report

Automatic scoring across **5 dimensions** after each session:

```
┌─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dimension           │ Detection Logic                                  │
├─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Empathy & Listening │ Did you acknowledge effort & ask about feelings? │
│ Attribution         │ Did you use open-ended questions to understand   │
│                     │ their view?                                      │
│ Specific Feedback   │ Did you use STAR method with concrete examples?  │
│ Improvement Plan    │ Did you co-create actionable next steps?         │
│ Goal Alignment      │ Did you connect personal growth to team          │
│                     │ direction?                                       │
└─────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Penalty detection:**
- Personal attacks / labeling → -2.0 points
- Blame ("It's all your fault...") → -0.8 points
- Vague feedback (effort without specifics) → -0.5 points

**Output:**
- Overall score (1–5, star display)
- Dimension completion status (✅ Covered / ❌ Not covered)
- Missing key actions with recommended phrases
- Pitfall alerts (if any)
- Improvement checklist

## 💡 Coaching Tips at a Glance

> Review = Connect → Present facts → Reach consensus

1. **Start with empathy**: "I've noticed you've been working late a lot lately — thank you. How have things been feeling?"
2. **Ask open-ended questions**: "What's your take?" "What do you think might be causing this?"
3. **Give feedback with specifics**: "For example, the XX requirement last week..."
4. **Co-create the plan**: "Let's set goals for the next two weeks — where do you think we could start?"
5. **Link to personal growth**: "Getting this right will really help your career path"
